				<h4>This website was inspired by my roommates Computing in the Arts assignment. Using a word list of his choosing, he had to form a random poem generator, and I thought that the results were too inspirational to not be published somewhere. I will try to make him give me a new poem/edit the poem generator daily.</h4>
